MailCommander is an interface to execute remote commands using the 
infrastructure of an MTA. It does so by parsing the data received
in the body of the email and fetching the command from either
the recipient of the email or the subject. 

It includes an authentication/authorization module, so commands can
be validated first before actually executing them. 

It should be called passing the ip address of the person that 
requests the command as an argument, and the email address should
be passed through stdin.

New commands may be added by placing them under the "cmds" folder
as python modules, and each command should extend the Command class.
This way, the code remains the same while being scalable.

Each command may return either text or html output after being
executed, and this output will be sent to the person that
requested the command as well as to every user that is responsable
for authorizing it. The output by default is generated using
Cheetah templates, although this behaviour might be overriden.

The current implementation includes commands for account handling
like adding new accounts or changing passwords on existing ones,
it uses MySQLdb and it's based on postfixadmin's db schema.

It's been tested under Postfix, but other MTAs should work as long 
as they allow setting custom transports for specific domains.


REQUERIMENTS:

-> Existing MTA (e.g. postfix)
-> Cheetah templates http://www.cheetahtemplate.org
